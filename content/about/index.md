This is my blog. I write about what I carefully describe as "Software Engineering", mostly around "Big" Data with Hadoop and various Cloud Providers, but pretty much everything that strikes my fancy. 

I am passionate about Open Source Software, will lecture people about GNU/Linux (I have this long-standing theory that this is the reason why I'm not invited to many parties anymore), and despise what I call "Meme Technology" (until I decide otherwise).
