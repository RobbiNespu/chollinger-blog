Welcome to my not-at-all generic blog. I write about nerdy stuff here, most likely Big Data, Cloud, Analytics, and UNIX-related.
I'm a Senior Consultant for all your data-related needs and know stuff about Google Cloud, Hadoop, Apache Storm, Heron, HBase, Kafka, Spark (...) and absolutely nothing about Kerberos.
